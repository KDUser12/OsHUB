## About The Project

OsHUB is an open source project based on the Python language listing over 40 sites and tools to help anyone interested in Osint. Each tool offered is free and open source, guaranteeing you a good experience and good security.

Basically, OsHUB should not only have been a program listing dozens of tools and websites but also allow downloading of proposed tools in advance. Seeing that this could expose users to possible security vulnerabilities, this functionality was removed at the beginning of its development to avoid conflicting with our ideas and our usage policy.

Here are some key aspects of OsHUB:

1. **Utilisation Local:** OsHUB does not under any circumstances use your internet connection to connect or exchange packets via third-party sites. OsHUB simply uses the `requests` module to communicate with itself via GitHub to find out the latest version of the program.

2. **Diversified set of websites and tools:** OsHUB offers a wide list of tools and websites to make Osint simple but we do not assure you that all tools and websites offer you increased security.

3. **User-friendly design:** We have tried our best to make OsHUB easy to understand and use, without the need to look at the documentation.

4. **Compliance and ethics:** While pushing the boundaries in a fun way, we always aim to stay within the limits set by European and American laws, promoting responsible and ethical use.

5. **Regular updates:** OsHUB does not guarantee regular and exhaustive updates, this is explained because OsHUB is maintained voluntarily by me but also by you and I have other projects on the side. We assure you that OsHUB will be continually updated with security updates.

OsHUB does not claim to be a grandiose masterpiece, it is a simple tool designed to provide a list of tools and websites to help you make osint.

## Getting Started

OsHUB is conveniently pre configured, simplifying the setup process for users. All that's required is to install Python and execute a straightforward batch file. It's that easy to get started.

### Installation

 clone the repository: 
```shell
git clone https://github.com/KDUser12/OsHUB.git
```
Then enter the directory:
```shell
cd OsHUB
```
Finally just run `python3 oshub` and use OsHUB.
